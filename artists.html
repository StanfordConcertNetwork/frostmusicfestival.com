            <p class="lead">Born Anton Zaslavski in southwest Germany, Grammy-winning electronic producer Zedd broke onto the European dance scene in 2010 with a remix of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5he5w2lnU9x7JFhnwcekXX" target="blank">Skrillex</a>'s "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites." Though known for his glitch, pulsing production, Zedd's musical journey began in the acoustic realm. Raised in a musical family, the future producer cut his teeth on the piano at four years old and eventually moved on to drums and played in a rock band before being drawn into the digital world in 2009.</p>

            <p>Zedd built a name for himself with his remixes of artists like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1HY2Jd0NmPuamShAr6KMms" target="blank">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ndkK3dpZLKtBklKjxNQwT" target="blank">B.o.B</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cQA9WH8liZfeja1DxcDYE" target="blank">Armand Van Helden</a> while also releasing his own singles and EPs.</p>

            <p>In late 2012, the young producer delivered his first full-length, the club-worthy <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7juWTdmjo0vYywWu8HiQxs" target="blank">Clarity</a>, whose lead single, "Spectrum," shot to the top of the U.S. dance chart. One of the follow-ups, "Stay the Night," featuring <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Rx1JKzBrSzoKQtmbVmBnM" target="blank">Hayley Williams</a>, reached number two on the British pop charts. The title track, featuring British pop singer <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7qRll6DYV06u2VuRPAVqug" target="blank">Foxes</a> on vocals, won a Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 2014. That same year, Zedd scored another hit with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR" target="blank">Ariana Grande</a>'s track "Break Free."</p>

            <p>In 2015 he released his sophomore LP, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4jKdXIJckKh7la6xHuKwRT" target="blank">True Colors</a>, which presented more diversity with genres like rock and rap as influences. The collection featured <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0C8ZW7ezQVs4URX5aX7Kqx" target="blank">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3WGpXCj9YhhfX11TToZcXP" target="blank">Troye Sivan</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4xRYI6VqpkE3UwrDrAZL8L" target="blank">Logic</a> among its guests, and topped the Billboard dance/electronic chart. An international tour in support of the album followed.

            <p>In 2017 he issued the single "Stay," featuring Canadian singer <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2wUjUUtkb5lvLKcGKsKqsR" target="blank">Alessia Cara</a> on vocals.</p>
