            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>This year, the Stanford Concert Network is proud to announce the 7th Annual Frost Music &amp; Arts Festival. Each year, we celebrate the arts by dedicating a day to admiring art created by our fellow classmates. We are given the opportunity to showcase different student commissioned art installations as well as invite a student artist to share the stage with Grammy winning performers. Thousands of students come out to support their peers, making the festival the one of the most attended events by both the undergraduate and graduate students.</p>


            <p>Historically, the festival has been held in Frost Amphitheater. In the warm spring air, doors open and attendees wander around the grounds, laden with student artwork and decorations. People begin filling the grassy bowl to listen to the student opener. By late afternoon, the crowd fills the grassy bowl, swaying to the music of many genres. Previous headliners include Zedd, Fetty Wap, Flume, Dispatch, MGMT, and Modest Mouse.</p>

            <p>This year, Frost Amphitheater is still under renovations. We will be hosting this year’s Frost Music &amp; Arts Festival in the Stanford Stadium. Although relocating such a large event has presented its challenges, we have also had many new opportunities. We are trying to maintain the amphitheater aesthetic, inviting guests to be on the field and up through the bleachers. The festival will begin in the late afternoon and end after dark. The additional element of night has allowed us to experiment with different set production, creating a new and unique experience.</p>

            <p>We hope you are excited as we are for Frost and hope to see you there on May 19th!</p>
