      The Frost Music & Arts Festival is an annual event organized by the
      <a href="https://scn.stanford.edu">Stanford Concert Network</a>. 
      This year is not only the 9th anniversary of Frost, but also
      the first year that the festival returns to the Frost amphitheater since 
      2019. Past artists include MGMT, Phoebe Bridgers, Kali Uchis, Kaytranada, 
      Jai Wolf, Flume, Omar Apollo, Raveena, Jorja Smith, and more! 
      We are excited to announce this year's lineup, featuring Portland rapper
      Aminé, Victoria Monét, and Tkay Maidza. Join us for a day of live performances, 
      DJ sets, and visual art at Frost Amphitheater on May 21, 2022!
