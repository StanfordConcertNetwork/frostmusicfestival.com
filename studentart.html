          <p>No matter the context, histories, or associated memories, emotions connect individuals. The strongest of these connections tend to be those tied with the extremes of the emotional spectrum— more specifically, extreme happiness and extreme sadness. “100% HAPPINESS” explores how these emotions are evoked through childhood nostalgia and substance abuse in its representation as a friendly and familiar motif of immature consumption, paralleling the temptation of drugs and other substances. </p>

            <p>Cyan (b. 2000, Netherlands) is a Dutch-American artist and current senior at Stanford majoring in a self-designed engineering concentration called Human Immersive Design. Her work asks audiences to evaluate the role of technology in their lives and how innovations have shaped or changed the ways we communicate, form relationships, and express empathy. Through her sculptures and installations, Cyan hopes to invite viewers to touch, listen, and interact with questions surrounding technology in an engaging and immersive way. </p>

            <p>Cyan's "01011111 says hello" explores questions such as how do human ascribe emotions onto inanimate objects? Are we able to feel connected to what is not inherently human? In an increasingly technological world, we must ask ourselves how our daily interactions with AI objects, personalities, and robots influences our capacity for empathy both towards these creations and between each other. In a predominantly virtual world, how we treat the non-human sets the president for how we interact with one another. This playful installation asks the viewer to evaluate the emotions they ascribe to the objects they see. Do you resonate with any? What is their personality like?</p>

            <p>Bryan Monge Serrano '25 is a Nahua (Pipil) Salvadoran American photographer who was born and raised in Flushing, Queens in New York City. He started his photographic work with the Bronx Documentary Center under the guidance of industry professionals, such as Michael Kamber, Sean Sirota, Gabriela Bhaskar, and Desiree Rios. Bryan's photography is influenced by his experiences growing up in New York, all the photographers he has had the pleasure of meeting and whose work he has seen, and community in relation to his cultural background as well as the people who surround him no matter where he is. In the past, he published a photo essay documenting community organizing and Flushing and had a self-portrait relating to this published in the NYTimes. At Stanford, he has continued his photographic work primarily through the Art+Justice grant funded by IDA and is leading an independent project documenting civil engagement across the Bay Area and is also photographing for the Stanford Daily. </p>
            <p>Bryan's piece "Through our Eyes" documents the sunrise ceremony on Alcatraz for Indigenous People's Day, an event that is unseen by most Stanford students but is vital to the Indigenous community. Throughout the picture, you can follow the journey of students and see our community in community with other First Nations people.</p>

            <p>I wanted to commemorate, memorialize, and eulogize with this piece. Over the past few years, loss has begun haunting me and others, I gather. We need to relearn mourning: we need to connect through and with it. This piece is my attempt to do so. I got a concussion in January and, on the phone with my dad on a tearful Friday, I bemoaned the fact that all I’d been able to do that week was hand crochet. His response (ever the optimist) was that competency in yarn crafts (the ability to create textiles) would be a crucial skill in the upcoming climate apocalypse. So, I kept tying knots.</p>

I've always wanted to tell someone "Eat your heart out!" because, despite what I've been raised to believe as a woman, I am a prize that's worth being won. I do have value, and I am that bitch. This piece goes out to everyone who feels like they need to be submissive to survive, everyone who feels stepped on or walked over, discarded like an old piece of cake. Tell everyone who makes you feel that way to eat their hearts out, because you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Nibha Akireddy is a coterm student studying Electrical Engineering. She has been an artist her whole life, with a practice that was reinvigorated during the pandemic. Where she was once able to break up her engineering coursework with community and social interaction, she instead turned to music, film, and history classes that inspired a revitalized painting practice. She has shown her work at every Frost Festival since her freshman year and is excited and grateful to have one last exhibition with Frost and SCN. </p>
        <p>Broadly, Nibha is interested in thinking about what the art world expects of her as a Telugu-American artist. She likes to poke fun at exoticism and romantic imagery, both of which sometimes rebrand themselves as “representation.” She’s interested in thinking about how communities around her, both in and out of her diaspora, see “South Asian art" or, more broadly, “diasporic art". She likes to use her work to highlight the diversity within umbrella terms that multicultural artists are so often pushed into. Over the course of her time at Stanford, she’s realized that most of her influences can be found outside of typical “artistic” spaces. She finds creative community in cultural spaces, her residencies on campus, and close friendships. She finds inspiration from her peers who are engineers and writers and historians and sociologists and whatever else, who think introspectively and push her to do the same. She hopes to make both her fields, art and engineering, better community spaces for multi-faceted, diverse people who refuse to mold their stories to fit a marketable narrative. Her art is an amalgamation of many influences and inspirations and incoherent thoughts, but, at it’s core, it’s just a way for her to embrace that people can be so many things in such a beautiful way all at once. </p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Constantinos Gallis is a Greek-Swiss visual and sound artist, who uses a variety of media to create art. His main focus revolves around cities and urban life, and a lot of his art is directly linked to his hometown of Athens, Greece. Gallis is currently working on various ambient projects, as well as a series of paintings that attempt to capture sonic environments.</p>
        <p>"Murmuration of Light" is an installation that manipulates the light from the sun to create two distinct patterns. The dispersion of light by prisms into various colors was the main guiding principle behind the piece, as I attempted to split the single source of light into two distinct planes of light that act different to one another, but depend wholly on each other. This effect is achieved by using two different types of acrylic pieces to create the piece; blue translucent squares, and yellow reflective squares, each of which determine the direction of the incoming light. Suspended from a tree by a single rope, the blanket is vulnerable to the elements and sways in the wind, making the reflections move more erratically. It is accessible to all to touch, move, shake, and adjust, to see how the light it reflects and lets through changes. The piece can also be left alone, purely as an art object rather than an interactive piece. The piece is an experiment in light-manipulation, and an example of how a single piece can achieve two very different effects at the same time.

        <p> I am interested in examining the trivial, ordinary image, observed constantly and on a massive scale. The images that commonly employ this aesthetics were created with the intent of being observed with little investigation, of being aspirational yet unremarkable. They are images that we see every day. Their subjects are familiar to everyone due to the sheer mass of their proliferation. By providing such minimal information about the subjects or their environment, these images implicate the viewer by forcing them to draw conclusions based around their pre-existing notions alone. Because the stock images are removed from their traditional context on a billboard, page of a magazine, or commercial, what they create is an uncanny familiarity without a source. Viewers will recognize the common symbols, aesthetics, and motifs of the images from mass media, but they will be unable to place exactly why. With this, I am hoping viewers will be able to connect over this shared uncanny familiarity, as they discuss how mass media has informed the way they perceive each image.</p>
