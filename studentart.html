      <h3>Showcase your art at Frost!</h3>

      <br />

      <p>
        Stanford Concert Network's Frost Music and Arts Festival is an annual
        celebration of the musical and visual arts at Stanford. On Saturday, May
        21, 2022, Frost will be held in person in Frost Amphitheater for the
        first time in two years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each year, the Frost student art exhibition is curated around an aspect
        of the headliners that inspires our Stanford community. This year we
        will have performances by Aminé, Tkay Maidza, and Victoria Monét,
        dynamic artists who bridge gaps between diverse aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This year’s theme asks: How do we connect?</strong>
        <br />Connection is not just a compromise but sparks originality. Your
        art should speak to sites of connection that fuse different themes or
        experiences. As we return to Frost together, your installation should
        harbor a new site for connection.
