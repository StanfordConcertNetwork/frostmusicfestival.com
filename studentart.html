            <h3>Student Art</h3>
            <p>Each year at Frost Music and Arts Festival, we celebrate what the arts mean to our community by dedicating a day to admiring works created by our fellow classmates. The Frost concert on May 19th will be feature music by Glass Animals and student artists chosen in Battle of the Bands, as well as visual art created by students at Stanford.</p>

            <p>The show will be centered around the music festival experience, so perhaps itâ€™s a chance to think your own personal relationship with music and channel that into your works. However, there are no specific guidelines on aesthetics; design is up to you.</p>

            <p>Selected students will have their works showcased at Frost and there will be an opening party the evening before, on May 18. Additionally, they will be included in an exhibition catalogue and featured in a Stanford publication. A member from the Frost Arts Committee will be paired with each artist for guidance and assistance, and artists will all have consistent contact with the Lead Student Art Curator. Selected projects will receive funding from Stanford to realize their ideas.</p>

            <p>More information about applying may be found below, and applications (due April 1) can be found <a href="http://tinyurl.com/frostartapp">here</a>. Mitzi Harris, the Lead Student Art Curator, will hold office hours at Coupa near Green Library on Tuesdays 12-1:20 and Wednesdays 3:30-4:30. Please email any questions to msharris@stanford.edu.</p>
