            <h3>Student Art</h3>
            <p>Each year, we celebrate the arts by dedicating a day to admiring art created by our fellow classmates. We are given the opportunity to showcase different student commissioned art installations as well as invite a student artist to share the stage with Grammy winning performers. Thousands of students come out to support their peers, making the festival the one of the most attended events by both the undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
