            <p>At the age of 21, Adam Aminé Daniel burst onto the scene with his now 6x platinum single, "Caroline." But, the Portland-born rapper has come a long way since then; a fact made clear by his critically acclaimed releases. "Good For You" drew praise on arrival with writeups in XXL, The New York Times, Complex, and more. And "Limbo," released in 2020, debuted in the Top 10 of the Billboard Top Hip Hop Albums chart with features from Young Thug, Summer Walker, Vince Staples, and more</p>

            <p>Between explosive sets at Coachella and Lollapalooza, plus a show-stopping performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Aminé has solidified himself as a force of nature. Making his acting debut on HBO's "Insecure," he's proven that his talents go beyond the studio and the stage to a whole new medium of entertainment. Coming off of a 2021 Grammy nomination for Disclosure collaboration, "My High", Aminé has more extensive plans to revisit the world of dance/hip-hop crossover records. As live music returns, the second half of this year will feature a variety of innovative, genre-bending releases that could come at no better time for packing a dance floor.</p>

            <p>Nothing is holding Tkay Maidza ('tee-kay my-dzuh') back, and on her whiplash-inducing new new trilogy-capping EP Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 3, the Australian-Zimbabwean singer-rapper doubles down on her intent to exhilarate. Released in July 2021, Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 3 features dreamy “Cashmere”, technicolor baddie anthem “Syrup” and grimy “Kim (ft Yung Baby Tate)”, the latter of which earned a shout as Pitchfork’s #2 Best Music Video of the Month, besting even Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, with many others hailing it one of the best videos of the year. 2021 firmly established Maidza as an artist of global importance with cover across the globe from NME to Galore to 10 and more. This fall saw SOLD OUT NYC, LA and LONDON headlining performances - as well as performances with Charli XCX and Ashnikko, and festivals including ACL and Day N Vegas.</p>
